Welcome Summer, the hotter season of the year and the season wher I don't like cocking or making tea.
But I ***need*** drink tea for survive. I like drink tea when working, when I am tired, when I am reading... 

So I find a way to make tea without heat. And I don't want to make hot tea, it's summere, I want to make cold tea.
