This is my personal tea space, my personal TeaRoom, in the Digital space.

Here i will put my experiments into tea and similar things and I will updating when I have time to do it.
Not less, not more.

This is more something like a lab journal, with my experiment, annotation and thoughts into tea.

Sometime it will be serius, sometime free thought and sometime very planned post but allwayes about tea.
